# Literotica to Kindle

This is a simple app to pick up hot new stories in your favorite genres, and send them to your Kindle. Check out [Literotica.com](http://www.literotica.com) for more info.

## To Run
You'll need to store your favorite genres in a `.env` file. Separate them by pipes (`|`). Because the top genre page has a weird link system, it's easiest to grab the links from the site itself. You only need the genre and the number that follows. (That will make sense when you start looking at the [lists](https://www.literotica.com/top/)). The file needs to look like this:
```ruby
GENRE_LINKS=Erotic-Couplings-2|First-Time-40
```


### To Literotica
Seriously, what would I have done for the past... twenty years without you? If you're interested in hiring someone to develop an open API for you (to avoid this web scraping, perhaps), please get in touch! I've got lots of ideas for improvements to the user experience.
